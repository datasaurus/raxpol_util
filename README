WHAT IS THIS?

raxpol_util is a set of Unix programs that fetch and display data from RaXPol
moment files - files that the RaXPol signal processor writes, with names
like RAXPOL-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.dat. The programs do not read RaXPol "raw" files.

The software runs on Single Unix Specification V4 systems [1][2]. It has been
tested on Ubuntu Linux, MacOS X, and FreeBSD.

Distribution license is BSD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

make builds and installs the utilities, like so:

$ cd src
$ make
$ make install

By default, software installs in /usr/local. This requires superuser
privileges.  Define a different destination with PREFIX, e.g.

$ make install PREFIX=${HOME}/local

In this case, add ${HOME}/local/bin to PATH to make the utilities visible,
like so:

$ export PATH=${HOME}/local/bin:$PATH

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMAND LINE UTILITIES

The following utilities access RaXPol moment files. See the man pages for
complete details.  Note: for "old" RaXPol files, made before 2011, go:
"export RAXPOL_OLD_FMT=1" before running the utilities.

raxpol_file_hdr
    Prints a file header, e.g.

    $ raxpol_file_hdr /home/radarop/data/072814/RAXPOL-20140728-180536.dat

raxpol_ray_hdrs
    Prints ray headers.

    $ raxpol_ray_hdrs /home/radarop/data/072814/RAXPOL-20140728-180536.dat

    prints all ray headers. Output is clunky but easy to manipulate.  It is
    also large, about 20 megabytes per gigabyte of RaXPol data.

    $ raxpol_ray_hdrs -a /home/radarop/data/072814/RAXPOL-20140728-180536.dat

    prints a shorter list commonly used header values - time, location,
    azimuth, and elevation.

    $ raxpol_ray_hdrs -a -s 1000 -c 100 /home/radarop/data/072814/RAXPOL-20140728-180536.dat

    prints abbreviated headers for 100 rays starting at ray index 1000.

raxpol_dat
    Prints moment data values. The man page describes the output, and options
    that select moments and ranges of rays. Beware of voluminous output.

raxpol_mk_vols
    Prints an index of sweeps and volumes for a set of RaXPol moment files.
    A sweep is a set of rays with a common azimuth or elevation. A volume
    is a sequence of sweeps. RaXPol moment files assign a sweep and volume
    for each ray, but the information is unreliable for complicated sector
    scans and RHI's. raxpol_mk_vols searches sequences of azimuths and
    elevations ray headers for sweep and volume patterns. Command line options
    tune the search.

    Sample usage:

    $ raxpol_mk_vols /home/radarop/data/072814/RAXPOL*.dat > vol_list

    Note that the command line specifies all RaXPol files in the directory.
    Do this because volumes sometimes straddle file boundaries. raxpol_mk_vols
    can take several minutes if the RaXPol files are large. Upon successful
    completion, vol_list will be a human readable text file with a list of file
    paths, volume identifiers of form YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS, and sweep headers.

raxpol_sweep_svg
    Makes a sweep image given raxpol_mk_vols output for a sweep defined with
    command line options. See DISPLAYING INDIVIDUAL SWEEPS below.

raxpol_idx_html
    Makes a web site for a set of RaXPol files. See BROWSING VOLUMES AND
    SWEEPS below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISPLAYING INDIVIDUAL SWEEPS

First index the data with raxpol_mk_vols, e.g.

$ raxpol_mk_vols /home/radarop/data/072814/RAXPOL*.dat > vol_list

Then browse the vol_list for a volume identifier (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS) near a
time of interest, e.g. 20140728-204200. Volume identifiers appear on lines
that start with "Vol". Then pick a sweep angle, e.g. 1.0 degrees.

Then go:

$ raxpol_sweep_svg DBZ 1.0 20140728-204200 < vol_list

The first argument specifies the data type. It must be one of: DBMHC DBMVC
DBZ DBZ1 VEL ZDR PHIDP RHOHV STD SNRHC or SNRVC. The second argument is sweep
angle.  raxpol_sweep_svg will display the sweep from volume 20140728-204200
with angle nearest the specified angle.  If all goes well, raxpol_sweep_svg
will create a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file and print its name.

Open the SVG file with a web browser. It should display a sweep. If the
web browser has Javascript and runs on the system with raxpol_util installed,
the image will be interactive.  Pan the image with the mouse. Zoom with the
mouse wheel, or "+" and "-". Edit /usr/local/share/raxpol/raxpol_sweep.css or
${HOME}/local/share/raxpol/raxpol_sweep.css, as appropriate, to adjust fonts
and colors. Save the image to Postscript or PDF with the browser "Print"
menu. Note that File->Save will save the original image, forgetting any
panning or zooming.

Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator can also open and edit the image.

Use ImageMagick's convert command to convert the image to other image formats,
e.g.

$ convert RAXPOL-20140728-204200_DBZ_PPI_1.0.svg RAXPOL-20140728-204200_DBZ_PPI_1.0.png

Note that ImageMagick ignores style sheets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BROWSING VOLUMES AND SWEEPS

raxpol_util includes software to browse images on a web site. The system will
need a web server. raxpol_util is set up for mini-httpd, which is a small,
simple web server. Regular users can start and stop it.

On MacOS X, MacPorts lists it as thttpd (tiny/turbo/throttling web server).
Install with:

$ sudo port install thttpd

On Ubuntu, it goes by mini_httpd. Install with:

$ sudo apt-get install mini-httpd

On other systems, install with the system package manager - yum or apt-get,
or build from source [3][4].

Install raxpol_util again, but with "make install-www" e.g.

$ make install-www PREFIX_WWW=${HOME}/pecan/raxpol/www

where PREFIX_WWW gives the path to the web site. Read carefully. The make
target is not "install", it is "install-www". The destination is not "PREFIX",
it is "PREFIX_WWW". In this example, web pages and images will appear in
${HOME}/pecan/raxpol/www. Go to the web site directory.  ls should produce:

$ ls
bin cgi-bin conf libexec share

Add the bin directory to PATH and make a site index with raxpol_idx_html:

$ raxpol_idx_html /path_to_raxpol_files localhost:2014

path_to_raxpol_files must specify a directory with RaXPol data files. They
can either be in the directory, or they can be one level down, e.g. if the
RaXPol files are collected by case. The first time it runs, raxpol_idx_html
makes volume and sweep indeces, which can take a while. localhost is the host
name. Every computer refers to itself as localhost. 2014 is the port number.
It should be an integer greater than 1023. See [5][6]. If using mini-httpd,
start the web server with:

$ . ./libexec/start-httpd

Do not worry about "bind: Address already in use".  Then point a browser to
http://localhost:2014 . If all goes well, an index will appear. Click the link
for a sweep to view it. The image behaves like one raxpol_sweep_svg created. In
addition, left and right arrows select previous and next volumes. Up and down
arrows select higher and lower sweep angles. Click on the moment name in the
title for a pop up menu of moments.  Click on the sweep angle in the title for
a pop up menu of sweep angles. Bug note: to drag a new image, click on a colored
area.

Note: Web server EXITS, and web site DISAPPEARS, at log out. If httpd balks
at start up, check for renegade servers on Linux with 'ps -ef | grep httpd',
on MacOS X with 'ps -x -o pid,ppid,command -U $USER', and kill them.

raxpol_idx_html has to run only once. If logging back in, restart httpd
like so:

$ . ./libexec/start-httpd

Images lazily appear on demand in the img directory in the web site directory. 
They stay for faster reloading. If img becomes too big, clear it out like this:

$ find img -name '*.svg' | xargs rm

The server will make new images if they are needed again.

A localhost site only works on the machine where the server is running.
To view on other machines, specify the machine address, e.g.

$ raxpol_idx_html /path_to_raxpol_files 10.197.12.192:2014

and take the browser to http://10.197.12.192:2014 . For worldwide viewing,
specify port 80, the "well known port" for the Web. On most systems, only
superuser can use port 80.

Tip: The raxpol data files should NOT be on the web site. The web server
will call raxpol_util commands and tell them where the data files are.
Visiting web browsers will be oblivious. They will only see images. Keep it so.

Tip: Chrome, Safari, and Opera are fast. Firefox huff and puffs a lot.

Other web servers, such as apache, nginx, and python simplehttpserver should
work. Configure according to the server documentation and, if necessary,
modify cgi-bin/raxpol_sweep.cgi, which tells the server how to make images.
